# INFCoin-Project

## Description

For our project, we created an ERC20 coin called INFCoin.  INFCoin, or Inflation Coin, uses the percent change in CPI to adjust the amount of the holders tokens to account for inflation. The tokens are added or subtracted monthly, depending on if inflation increases or decreases.
